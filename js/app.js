//Optional Challenges
//=========================================================================

//Frequency Counter - sameFrequency
//Write a fucntion called sameFrequency.  Given two positive integers, findout if
//the two numbers have the same frequency of digits.

//Solution MUST have Time Complexity: O(N);

//Sample input:
	//sameFrequency(182,281) true;
	//sameFrequency(34,14) false;
	//sameFrequency(22,222) false;

function sameFrequency(num1, num2) {

}


//Frequency Counter / Multiple Pointers - areThereDuplicates

//Implement a function caslled areThereDuplicates which accepts a varaible number of arguments,
//and checks whether there are any duplicates among the arguments passed in. You can solve this
//using the frequency counter pattern OR the multiple pointers pattern.

function areThereDuplicates() {

}

//Multiple Pointers - averagePair

//Write a function called averagePair. Given a sorted array of integers and a target average,
//determine if there is a pair of values in the array where the average of the pair equals
//the target average. There may be more than one pair that matches the average target.

function multiplePointers() {

}

//Multiple Pointers - isSubsequence

//Write a function called isSubsequence which takes in two strings and checks whether the
//characters in the first string form a subsequence of the characters in the second string.
//In others words, the function should check whether the characters in the first string 
//appear somewhere in the second string, without their order changing.

function isSubsequence() {

}

//Sliding Window - maxSubarraySum

//Given an array of integers and a number, write a function called maxSubarraySum, which finds
//the maximum sum of a subarray with the length of the number passed to the function.

//Note that a subarray must consist of consecutive elements from the origin array. In the first 
//example below, [100,200,300] is a subarray of the original array, but [100,300] is not.

//maxSubarraySum([100,200,300,400],2) 700
//maxSubarraySum([1,4,2,10,23,3,1,0,20],4) 39
//maxSubarraySum([-3,4,0,-2,6,-1],2) 5
//maxSubarraySum([3,-2,7,-4,1,-1,4,-2,1],2) 5
//maxSubarraySum([2,3],3) null

//SlidingWindow - minSubArrayLen

//Write a function called minSubArrayLen which accepts two parameters - an array of positive integers
//and a positive integer.

//This function should return the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum is greater
//than or equal to the integer passed to the fucntion.  If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

function minSubArrayLen() {

}

//Sliding Window - findLongestSubstring

//Write a function called findLongestSubstring, which accepts a string and returns the length
//of the longest substring with all distrinct characters.

//findLongestSubstring('') 0
//findLongestSubstring('rithmschool') 7
//findLongestSubstring('thisisawesome') 6
//findLongestSubstring('thecatinthehat') 7
//findLongestSubstring('bbbbbb') 1
//findLongestSubstring('longestsubstring') 8
//findLongestSubstring('thisishowwedoit') 6

function findLongestSubstring() {

}
